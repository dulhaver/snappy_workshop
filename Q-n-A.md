- can you creat your own SNAP `Store` or `Repo`?

absoulutely! Look for 2 projects 
    1. ~snapstore (Apache License)
    2. OpenStore (GPL)
    
- Installing a SNAP and a DEB (or RPM) of the same application simultaneousely

possible. SNAP will have higher priority, so the SNAP version of the application will be the default

- Can you sintall SNAPs without the use of a `repo` or `snapstore`?

yes, you can. `Snapstores` provide a usefull infrostructure for updating machanisms though
